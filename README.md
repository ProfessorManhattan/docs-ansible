# Ansible Role Documentation

This is a submodule repository that contains documentation partials used to generate the README.md and possibly other markdown files. It works in conjunction with the `blueprint.json` and `blueprint.md` files in the root of the parent repository.

To generate the documentation, run the following command in the same directory as the blueprint files:

```
npx @appnest/readme generate
```
