# Ansible Role Documentation

This repository is meant to be included as a submodule in [our Ansible project repositories](https://gitlab.com/megabyte-labs/ansible-roles). It includes documentation partials that are used to generate the documentation for each of our Ansible projects.

To generate the documentation in one of our Ansible project repositories, you can run:

```
bash .start.sh
```

Changes made to this repository will automatically propagate to our Dockerfile projects via GitLab CI.
