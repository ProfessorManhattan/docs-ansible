<blockquote>
I create open source projects out of love. Although I have a job, shelter, and as much fast food as I can handle, it would still be pretty cool to be appreciated by the community for something I have spent a lot of time and money on. Please consider sponsoring me! Maybe I'll be able to quit my job and publish open source full time.

Sincerely,

***Brian Zalewski***
