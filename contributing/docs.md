## Updating Meta Files

All of our Ansible roles share common files that need to be updated occasionally. You can update all the roles by running `bash update.sh` in the [main playbook's `misc/` folder]({{ repository.playbooks }}).

If you want to update a single role, you can do so by running `update.sh` in the repository's root.
