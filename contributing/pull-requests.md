## Pull Requests

All pull requests should be associated with issues. You can find the [issues board on GitLab]({{ repository.playbooks }}). The pull requests should be made to [the GitLab repository]({{ repository.group.ansible_roles }}/{{ role_name }}) instead of the [GitHub repository]({{ profile.github }}/ansible-{{ role_name }}). This is because we use GitLab as our primary repository and mirror the changes to GitHub for the community.
