This repository contains Ansible playbooks that provision both desktop development environments and servers. Almost all the roles included by this playbook are custom-made, cross-platform (i.e. Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows), and highly config-driven. All of the software included in this set of playbooks is the result of hours of researching what the best development software is (by comparing GitHub stars, "Top 10" blog articles, and looking through GitHub awesome lists). This set of playbooks is ideal for someone who uses several different operating systems or frequently switches between operating systems.
