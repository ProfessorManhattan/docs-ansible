## Quick Start

The easiest way to run the `main.yml` playbook is to run the following command on Linux or Mac OS X:

```shell
bash <(wget -qO- https://gitlab.com/ProfessorManhattan/Playbooks/-/raw/master/files/quickstart.sh)
```

The above command will install the dependencies and run the `main.yml` playbook on a single machine. This is probably the best way to get your feet wet before you decide to give us a ⭐ and customize the playbook for your own needs. See the [Windows section[(#windows)] if you are looking to test this playbook out on Windows.
