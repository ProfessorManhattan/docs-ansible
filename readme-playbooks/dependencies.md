## Requirements

### Mac OS X

We use [mas](https://github.com/mas-cli/mas) to install apps from the App Store in some of our roles. Sadly, automatically signing into the App Store is not possible on OS X 10.13+ via mas. This is because [mas no longer supports login functionality on OS X 10.13+](https://github.com/mas-cli/mas/issues/164).

There is another caveat with mas. In order to install an application using mas, the application has to have already been added via the App Store GUI. This means that the first time around you will have to install the apps via the App Store GUI so they are associated with your App Store account.
