## Supported Operating Systems

The following chart shows the operating systems that have been tested for compatibility. This chart is automatically generated using the Ansible Molecule tests you can view in the `molecule/` folder. We currently have logic in place to handle Debian, RedHat, and Archlinux. If your operating system is not listed but is a variant of Debian, RedHat, or Archlinux then it might work.
